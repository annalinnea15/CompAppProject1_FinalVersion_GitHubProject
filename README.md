# CompAppProject1_FinalVersion_GitHubProject
Final version of Comp App Project 1 for Anna Towle and Kaustubh Karnataki

Our application is designed to work for any EQ and SSH files (tested on the lab hands on files and given assignment files provided all the component type specified are provided inthe file). It can parse and work with any number of compnenets and buses. It can createa y-bus matrix for any size system and also takes the breaker status into account when building the y-bus matrix. A jar file is used to run the entire application, which is controlled by a two-tab, menu option GUI. The GUI can display a y-bus matrix of any size. 
Steps to operate: 
1. Download the project folder   
2. Run the jar file   
3. Follow instructions on home page   
4. Check the y-bus tab    
5. The database can be viewed on the SQL workbench         

NOTE: The password and username must be root for the SQL workbench           
NOTE2: make sure the 3 goodie files are added to the project as external JARs               
NOTE3: The images folder must also be copied as a source folder in the project (if you want to run the program in eclipse directly)   NOTE4: The mysql driver must be added as an external jar (if you want to run it in eclipse directly)
